@VZW.xlsx can you go through the Excel file and create a mobile/Streamlit application that can do the following:
1) The application starts with a form that gets information from the user. It should replicate the 'Baseband Swap' sheet of the Excel file.
2) After successfully filling in the 'Baseband Swap' form of stage 1, the NEXT screen should contain a drop-down list containing all 40  items of the sheet 'Photo List'. The user has to select one from the drop-down list and then press the CAPTURE button, which, after being pressed, initiates the device camera. The user navigates the device and captures an image. The image should be processed and converted to the PNG format with a max size of 1MB and stored in a dedicated location with the name provided by the user at the time of capture. The picture name should be appended with the name selected from the drop-down menu. After the capture, the screen should return to the drop-down list screen.
3) When all the pictures are taken, an Excel file should be created similar to VZY.xlsx in the background, containing the exact 4 sheets with the same name. The information gathered from the stage 1 form should be placed in the 'Baseband Swap' sheet with the same form-like appearance as in the VZW.xlsx file. The pictures taken should be placed in the 'Photos' sheet with the same matrix-like formatting exactly as in the VZW.xlsx file.
4) There should be a separate DOWNLOAD button available besides the CAPTURE button that, when pressed, downloads the complete Excel file, similar to the VZW.xlsx file, to the device.
